            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>USS Akron (ZRS-4) was a helium-filled rigid airship of the U.S. Navy, the lead ship of her class, which operated between September 1931 and April 1933. She was the world's first purpose-built flying aircraft carrier, carrying F9C Sparrowhawk fighter planes, which could be launched and recovered while in flight. With an overall length of 785 ft (239 m), Akron and her sister ship Macon were among the largest flying objects ever built. Although LZ 129 Hindenburg and LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II were some 18 ft (5.5 m) longer and slightly more voluminous, the two German airships were filled with hydrogen, so the two US Navy craft still hold the world record for the largest helium-filled airships.[2]</p>

            <h2>History of Service</h2>
            <p>The USS Akron, commissioned in 1931, was the U.S. Navy’s first purpose-built flying aircraft carrier—an immense helium-filled airship designed to scout vast oceanic areas while launching and recovering F9C Sparrowhawk fighter planes midair. Throughout her short service, she demonstrated novel tactics in naval reconnaissance, took part in fleet exercises, tested spy baskets and aircraft trapeze systems, and completed missions along both U.S. coasts and the Caribbean. Despite her technological promise, Akron faced numerous handling issues and accidents, culminating in a tragic crash during a storm in April 1933 off the New Jersey coast, where 73 of 76 aboard perished, marking the deadliest airship disaster in history and signaling the decline of rigid airships in naval operations.
