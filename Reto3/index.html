                        The Graf Zeppelin II was virtually identical to the Hindenburg, and was originally designed to use hydrogen as lifting gas.[citation needed] The LZ 130 was built to replace the aging LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin on the South American transatlantic route while the Hindenburg would continue flying the North American route. Following the Hindenburg disaster in May 1937, Dr Hugo Eckener vowed never again to use hydrogen in a passenger airship. This led to modifications so that the Graf Zeppelin II could be inflated with helium. The only source of helium in large enough quantities at that time was the United States, so Eckener traveled to Washington, D.C. to lobby for helium for his airships. He visited President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who promised to supply helium, but only for peaceful purposes. After the German annexation of Austria in March 1938, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes refused to supply helium, and the Graf Zeppelin II was ultimately inflated with hydrogen.

                    <p>
                        The LZ 130 *Graf Zeppelin II*, active between 1938 and 1939, conducted 30 flights totaling over 36,000 km and 400 hours in the air. Though originally intended for transatlantic passenger service, it was never used commercially due to the U.S. embargo on helium, relying instead on hydrogen. The airship's missions were primarily propaganda and reconnaissance, with radio surveillance activities onboard, including a covert attempt to detect British radar capabilities along the North Sea. Flights ranged from demonstrations over German cities to politically charged missions like the Sudetenland journey and espionage-oriented expeditions. With the onset of WWII, the airship was grounded and dismantled in 1940, marking the end of Germany's rigid airship era.

                        The end of the Zeppelins

                        A flight to Königsberg was planned for 26 August 1939, but was cancelled. It had been decided by the Aviation Ministry that the airships were a potential hazard with the imminent war. On this day, the LZ 130 was removed from the hangar, turned around and re-entered the hangar in a position convenient for its eventual dismantling. By 1 September, the LZ 130 had its gas cells deflated, fuel drained from the engines and all electrical equipment removed. Until January 1940, several attempts were made by Eckener and the Zeppelin Company to mothball the airship so that it could be recommissioned after the war, but on 20 November 1939, a DZR Supervisory Board meeting decided that the two Graf Zeppelins would be scrapped and their hangars demolished. The DZR continued to appeal this decision but was unsuccessful.

                        On 29 February 1940, Göring issued the order to scrap both Graf Zeppelins and the unfinished framework of LZ 131, since the metal was needed to build airplanes. By 27 April, work crews had finished disassembling the airships and recycling all the materials. On 6 May, the enormous airship hangars in Frankfurt were levelled by explosives, three years to the day after the destruction of the Hindenburg.
